# Rusty Rays

Learning Rust by implementing a ray tracer.

My latest rendered image:

## To-Do list

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] GitHub Actions
- [ ] Closed loop ray casting per pixel
- [ ] Unified material struct instead of enums-per-material

## Book(s) Used

This is not me deriving computer graphics theory, just getting familiar with the Rust language.

As such, I'm following along with existing resources implementing their solutions in Rust as an exercise.
