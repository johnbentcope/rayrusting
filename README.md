# Rusty Rays

Learning Rust by implementing a ray tracer.

My latest rendered image:

![Latest rendered image](./image.png)

## To-Do list

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] GitHub Actions
- [ ] Closed loop ray casting per pixel
- [ ] GUI mode for adjusting parameters
- [ ] Sequential rendering across the full image
- [ ] Loading scenes from files
- [ ] Render triangles
- [ ] Subsurface scattering
- [ ] Render STLs
- [ ] Render OBJs
- [ ] Unified material struct instead of enums-per-material
- [ ] Batch mode to only render part of image and return
- [ ] GPU compute

## Project Goals

- [ ] Cornel box render
- [ ] "Icy" bouncy ball material render
- [ ] Stanford dragon model render
- [ ] Batch process pipeline

## Book(s) Used

This is not me deriving computer graphics theory, just getting familiar with the Rust language.

As such, I'm following along with existing resources implementing their solutions in Rust as an exercise.
